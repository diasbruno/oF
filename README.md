oF is a script to manage the installation of openFrameworks and add-ons.

i wrote it yesterday before i found http://ofxaddons.com/.

hope we can integrate http://ofxaddons.com/ and port it to other languages like python...

Usage:
	cd $OF_HOME
	git remote add oF git@github.com:diasbruno/oF.git
	./oF.rb help
