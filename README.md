oF is a script to manage your the installation of openFrameworks and add-ons.

i wrote it yesterday before i found http://ofxaddons.com/.

hope we can integrate with http://ofxaddons.com/ and port it to other languages like python...


clone this script in the same folder you have your openframeworks - NOT in the openframeworks folder.


Usage:
	
	./oF.rb help
